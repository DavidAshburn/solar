We go direct to the suppliers to get the best value for our customers and we stand behind every installation with comprehensive warranties and service. We are always here to help.
</p>

<p>
Our expert team of local consultants and solar technicians have helped thousands of other families in Hawaii take control of their power bill and reduce their carbon footprint.

Whether you need a new system, or your old one isn’t performing the way it used to, we can help.
</p>

<p>
Our range of top-of-the-line solar equipment is unmatched when it comes to performance for the dollar. We stand by our work, and we couldn’t do that without using low-maintenance products you can rely on to perform day-in and day-out.

We go direct to the supplier so that we don’t have to compromise on quality to provide the best value in Hawaii.
</p>

<p>
Government incentives, tax forms, applications, and permits can be overwhelming to tackle all on your own. 

We handle all of that from start to finish, 
you have better things to do.
</p>

<p>
Our reputation lives on rooftops all across Hawaii, so we treat every one of them like our own.

After a new installation our technician will leave you with all the information you need to take good care of your solar system (it’s not much!). But sometimes things happen, so we offer a wide variety of maintenance, warranty, and solar panel repair services as well. 

Your new system will come with powerful monitoring software you can access, but we’ll keep an eye on it for you as well, and let you know if there is a problem with power output or battery capacity.
