    SolarTech Industries is one of the largest Solar installation and service companies in Hawaii. We need to support all of our thousands of past customers and continue to offer a range of choices in hardware to new customers, so we do not specialize. We are known for standing behind our work, and we can service all kinds of solar systems, large and small, new and old. Tesla, Enphase, LG Chem, Panasonic, BYD, Sonnen, if you have it, we’ve seen it before.

    Some components degrade over time before they fail outright, unless you have monitoring software this kind of thing can be hard to spot until the power bill arrives. if your system efficiency is falling it’s usually a simple fix. Replacing old inverters or upgrading to modern, more efficient solar panels can make a world of difference without replacing a whole system. 

    You want to avoid replacing full systems since the return on investment comes over time with solar power, you need the system to be as low-maintenance as possible to recoup installation costs. This is the main reason we prefer durable components to high-output ones in solar system design.
