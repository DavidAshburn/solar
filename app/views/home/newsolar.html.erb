            We take a lot of pride in designing systems that fit your needs, rooftop, and budget. They should pay for themselves as quickly as possible, and keep providing free power for years to come. Recent advances in battery chemistry and panel materials have only made that easier.
            <br><br>
            We will take a look at your power use patterns, sunlight exposure, rooftop layout, and nightly power needs. It all plays a part in selecting the right equipment, laying it out for the best exposure, and integrating it with any existing hardware you might have. Once you approve a design, we take it from there.
            <br><br>
            We handle all the permits and approvals and once finished, we can schedule your installation. You donâ€™t need to do anything except flip the power switch.

  We go direct to the suppliers to get the best equipment we can find at the lowest price. It will all be left outside for actual decades, so quality is crucial. Replacements eat into your savings so we use hardware with strong warranties and low failure rates. Panels should last you 25-30 years, and batteries 10-15 years.
  <br><br>
  We minimize other costs by assessing how much generation and storage is required and building to your specific need. With a recent power bill, we can estimate the time to break even for you as well. If you can generate all of your own power the savings really add up fast.
