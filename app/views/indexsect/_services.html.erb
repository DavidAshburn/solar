          <h4>Upgrades</h4>
          <p>
            When your life grows, we can help your system keep up. 
            <br>
            Our inspections are free, and we do NEM upgrades, modular battery storage, microinverters, panels, and more. 
            We try to preserve the equipment you already paid for. We'll talk about your recent power needs, and find the smallest change that meets them.

          <h4>Service</h4>
          <p>
            20 years is a long time on any rooftop.
            <br>
            If your system is showing its age, or you need warranty service, we have over 10 years of experience servicing all kinds of hardware.
            Even if we didn't install it, we've seen it before.
