                    <br><br>
                    Our consultants will talk with you about your regular power needs, patterns of use, your location's impact, and most importantly, 
                    what you want out of a solar system.
                    With that in mind, and access to a wide range of suppliers, we can find the most cost-effective options for your goals.
                    <br><br>
                    We handle permits and applications, install at your convenience, 
                    monitor your system performance afterwards, and we are always available if you need warranty or repair service.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013 we set out to be a one-stop solar company that our neighbors could trust, and that's just what we've done. Our core 
                    philosophy is to waste nothing and be a good neighbor, the business will take care of itself.
