                    Before we do anything else, we'll talk about your patterns of use, special needs like car charging, your location's impact, and most importantly, 
                    what you want out of a solar system.
                    With that in mind, and access to a wide range of suppliers, we can find the most cost-effective options for your goals.
                    <br><br>
                    We handle permits and applications, install at your convenience, 
                    monitor your system performance afterwards, and perform warranty arnd repair services.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013, we set out to be a one-stop solar company that our neighbors could trust, and that's just what we've done.
