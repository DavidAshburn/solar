              One of our local consultants will have a meeting with you to discuss what you want out of a solar system and your power use over the past year. They'll take that information and design a system that meets the goals you set. You may have a few options, but once you find a plan that you like, we take it from there.
              <br><br>
              We prepare and submit all the applications and approvals needed by the city and state. Their turnaround is usually 4-6 weeks long.
              <br><br>
              When approval comes back, we can schedule the installation and all you have to do is turn it on a few days later. You can download the monitoring app for your phone, but we keep an eye on your system for you and we'll let you know if we see a problem.

  Your household and reasons for going solar are unique, and the right solution for you needs to fit both. To solve 
  this problem we prefer modular components that let us minimize installation costs, upgrade easily down the line, 
  and keep repairs simple. Our preferred battery system comes with really powerful monitoring so you know what's 
  happening in real time. We also keep an eye on it for you so you never get a surprise power bill after a system fault.
